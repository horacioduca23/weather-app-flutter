## Implemented features:  
  - Predefined cities : "Montevideo", "Londres", "San Pablo", "Buenos Aires" and "Munich".
  - When user taps on one of it, it'll be redirected to the details screen with detailed weather information retrieved from OpenWeatherMap.com.
  - User can ask for permission to access to their GPS location and get current weather at that place.
  - User can search for any city in the world provided by GooglePlaces services.

## TODO features:
  - When user search for a particularly city and taps on it, it should show the current weather for that location.
